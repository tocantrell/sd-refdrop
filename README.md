# SD-RefDrop
This is an extension for the [ReForge version](https://github.com/Panchovix/stable-diffusion-webui-reForge) of the Automatic1111 Stable Diffusion web interface. Its purpose is to implement RefDrop image consistency based on [RefDrop: Controllable Consistency in Image or Video Generation via Reference Feature Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17661) (Fan et al. 2024). RefDrop allows for either consistency or diversification of diffusion model outputs based on an intially recorded output. 

For real-world application purposes, you can find a prompt and a seed with an output character or scene that you like and then apply aspects of that character to all future outputs. Alternatively you can also similarly find a seed with features you want to avoid and remove aspects of that image in future outputs. This level of consistency or diversification is controlled by the RFG Coefficent, which is a parameter that ranges from -1 to 1. Positive values force the outputs to be similar to the initial image while negative values ensure differences. It seems to work best in the 0.2 to 0.3 range for consistency or -0.2 to -0.3 range for diversification.

## Examples
The "Original" images were generated using a random seed, and then following images were made with a singular different seed. For the different seed a slight change was made to the prompt, denoted in brackets below:
```
Positive prompt:
score_9,score_8_up,score_7_up,
1girl,simple hoodie, jeans, solo,
light smile, [dancing,][library, studying,]
ponytail,looking at viewer,grey_background,wide_shot

Negative prompt:
score_6, score_5, score_4,
graphic t-shirt,
```
All were generated at 512x768 at CFG 7 using `Euler a` with 20 sampling steps. For this first set, all images were made using the WAI-CUTE-v6.0 fine tune of SDXL.

The following images use the same original saved output, but then are merged or diversified with using a separate, realistic fine tuned SDXL model. In practice, I've seen how this method can apply unrealistic aspects to a model trained on photos via consistency or emphasize the details and realism of an output using a negative RFG coefficent from an initial input from a less detailed model. The authors of the original paper also showed how this output diversification method can be used to help overcome stereotypes the model may have learned.

## Usage Guide
Install by using the `Extensions` tab from within the ReForge web interface. Navigate to the `Install from URL` tab and copy and enter the URL to this repository then click `Install`. When it finishes, go to the `Installed` tab and click `Apply and restart UI`. After reloading the interface, on the `txt2img` tab select `RefDrop` from the drop down menu at the bottom under `Script`.

First, find a specific image you want to use as the base for merging. Once you've found the single image output you'll use, save its seed using the recycle symbol next to the `Seed` field. Click `Enabled` from the RefDrop menu and under `Mode` select `Save`. The RFG Coefficient doesn't matter for this first step, as we are only saving the network details about the base image for the next step.

> [!WARNING]
> This will save a large amount of data to the `extensions\refdrop\latents` folder. The small base image above took 5,602 files totalling 7.3GB. More detailed images using hires fix and ADetailer can go much larger. However, this data is only written to disk during the `Save` step, and these files are deleted and replaced every time you run a new `Save`.

> [!TIP]
> This extension only saves one base image data at a time. If you have multiple images you care about, it might be easiest to save the details of the prompt and seed and rerun the `Save` step as needed. Alternatively, you can backup the contents of the `extensions\refdrop\latents` folder, but this is a lot of data.

After the save step finishes and you have recreated the original image you want to use for the process, you can now switch the mode to `Use` and set the RFG coefficent and described earlier. While `Enabled` is selected all outputs will use RefDrop.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When generating new images using RefDrop, the network parameters must be the same as the original saved image. In practical terms, this means only use models from the same lineage (for example, if using SD1.5 for the base image, only use SD1.5 fine tunes for the output). Also keep the `Width`, `Height`, `Sampling method`, `Schedule type`, and `Sampling steps` all the same. Additionally, keep the `Hires. fix`, `ADetailer`, or similar extra networks all the same between saving and using RefDrop. For `ADetailer`, this means making sure that the same number of objects are detected every time, by specifying the number under the `Detection` tab's `Mask only the top k` option.

## Afterword
A big thank you to the author of this paper for coming up with the idea and talking about it with me at NeurIPS 2024. There is a lot left to explore in this area, including applicability to other areas such as video. One important point that needs to be addressed for this implementation is figuring out how to prune what needs to be saved in order to acheive the desired consistency. The current implementation is saving all K and V values that are created at any point in during the image generation, which is probably overkill.
